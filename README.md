# Keyrings

THIS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

This is HTH, but **I do not claim this is the correct keyring.**
In fact I cannot verify it's authenticity, so I am not sure it is authentic.

If you find any problem, please [open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/hilbix/download-debian/issues), thanks.

## Purpose

I had problems verifying some of the keyrings.  Hence I put a copy here.

The idea is, that if it is fake, somebody else will spot and correct this in future.
Then one can come back here and verify the key again and detect there was fraud and act accordingly.

Or the opposite.  If in 10 years from now the key still is valid or can be validated, it is likely it is not fake.

- [devuan-devs.gpg](devuan-devs.gpg) because I found [no way to verify it](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/465797/23450)

- [copy/](copy/) a copy of some keyrings I came across, just in case

> Remember:  This here is not the source of the keyrings.  **Never trust me alone!**  Always cross-check things first.
